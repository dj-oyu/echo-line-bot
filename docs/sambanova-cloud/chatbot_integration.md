# Chatbot Integration Patterns with LLMs

Integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) like those on SambaNova Cloud into a chatbot requires careful consideration of conversation context, prompt engineering, and robust error handling. This document outlines best practices for building an intelligent LINE chatbot.

## 1. Conversation Context Management

LLMs are stateless by nature; they don't inherently remember past interactions. To enable a coherent conversation, we must explicitly provide the conversation history as part of each new prompt. However, LLMs have token limits, so managing this context efficiently is crucial.

### Strategies for Context Management:

-   **Truncation**: The simplest method is to send the most recent messages up to the LLM's token limit. This can be effective for short conversations but may lose context in longer ones.
-   **Summarization**: For longer conversations, periodically summarize the chat history using the LLM itself or another summarization model. This condenses information while retaining key details.
-   **Sliding Window**: Maintain a fixed-size window of recent messages. When the window is full, the oldest messages are dropped.
-   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For knowledge-intensive chatbots, store relevant information (e.g., product FAQs, user profiles) in a vector database. When a user asks a question, retrieve relevant chunks of information and include them in the prompt to the LLM. This helps ground the LLM's responses in factual data and reduces hallucinations.

### Implementation Considerations for LINE Bot:

-   **Storing History**: Conversation history can be stored in a temporary in-memory cache (for short-lived sessions) or a persistent database (e.g., DynamoDB, Redis) for longer-term context. The `event.source.user_id` from the LINE webhook can serve as a key to retrieve user-specific history.
-   **Prompt Construction**: The prompt sent to SambaNova Cloud will typically include:
    -   A **system message**: Defines the LLM's persona and instructions (e.g., "You are a helpful customer support agent.").
    -   **Conversation history**: A list of `{"role": "user", "content": "..."}` and `{"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}` messages.
    -   The **current user message**.

## 2. Prompt Engineering

Crafting effective prompts is key to getting desired responses from the LLM.

-   **Clear Instructions**: Be explicit about what you want the LLM to do.
-   **Role-Playing**: Assign a persona to the LLM (e.g., "You are a friendly chatbot that helps users with their queries.").
-   **Examples (Few-shot learning)**: Provide examples of desired input/output pairs to guide the LLM's behavior.
-   **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or rules the LLM should follow (e.g., "Keep responses concise.", "Do not answer questions about X.").

## 3. Handling LLM Responses

Once a response is received from SambaNova Cloud, it needs to be processed before being sent back to the LINE user.

-   **Extracting Content**: Parse the JSON response to extract the generated text.
-   **Post-processing**: Clean up the response (e.g., remove unwanted formatting, ensure it fits LINE's message limits).
-   **Error Handling**: If the LLM generates an inappropriate or irrelevant response, implement fallback mechanisms (e.g., a default message, escalating to human support).

## 4. Robust Error Handling

Integrating with an external API like SambaNova Cloud requires robust error handling to ensure the chatbot remains resilient.

-   **API Call Failures**: Implement `try-except` blocks around API calls to catch network errors, timeouts, or API-specific errors (e.g., invalid API key, rate limits).
-   **Retry Mechanisms**: For transient errors (e.g., network issues, rate limits), implement retry logic with exponential backoff to automatically re-attempt the request after a delay.
-   **Fallback Responses**: If the LLM API call fails after retries, provide a graceful fallback response to the user (e.g., "I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later."). Avoid showing raw error messages to the user.
-   **Monitoring and Logging**: Log all API requests and responses (carefully redacting sensitive information) and monitor for errors and performance issues. This helps in debugging and identifying recurring problems.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of SambaNova Cloud's rate limits and implement client-side rate limiting or queueing if necessary to avoid exceeding them.

## 5. Security Considerations

-   **API Key Security**: Ensure your SambaNova API key is stored securely (e.g., environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager) and never exposed in client-side code or logs.
-   **Input/Output Sanitization**: Sanitize user input before sending it to the LLM and sanitize LLM output before displaying it to the user to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
-   **Data Privacy**: Be mindful of what user data is sent to the LLM and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
